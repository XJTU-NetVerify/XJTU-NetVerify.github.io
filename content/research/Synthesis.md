intro = """Network controllers are complex and highly critical software systems in charge of enforcing a wide range of policies and services on top of a highly asynchronous environment (the network). As with any complex software, network controllers are likely to be plagued by bugs that must be discovered and fixed. While discovering these bugs is often hard, fixing them is even harder as controllers cannot simply be "rebooted" but need to be upgraded on-the-fly."""
