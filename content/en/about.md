We are a research lab of ANTS (Advanced NeTworked Systems) group, led by Prof. Peng Zhang.
Our lab focuses on the verification, simulation, and synthesis of large-scale computer networks.
We have proposed the data plane verifiers, APKeep (NSDI'20) and MNV (CoNEXT'23), and control plane verifiers, DNA (NSDI'22), SRE (SIGCOMM'22), and Expresso (SIGCOMM'24). Some of them are already open sourced.

Undergraduate students who are highly self-motivated, and interested in this research direction, are welcome to join our NetVerify lab (contact: p-zhang@xjtu.edu.cn)
