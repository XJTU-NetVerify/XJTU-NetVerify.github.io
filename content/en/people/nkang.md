[[introduction]]
    content = "
    I am a Ph.D. student in the NetVerify Lab at Xi’an Jiaotong University, advised by Prof. Peng Zhang.
    My research focuses on advancing formal methods from scalable and practical perspectives.
    I design a data structure to accelerate multi-round and incremental SMT solving, which has been successfully applied to access control policy analysis (AccessRefinery, FSE 2026).
    Moreover, I study how to efficiently encode network configurations as SMT constraints, thereby accelerating network verification (VeriBoost, FM 2026, under review).
    Besides, I also work on mining network specifications to help operators automatically write verification targets (NetMiner, ICNP 2023; NetMiner, TON 2025).
    Outside of research, I enjoy playing badminton and swimming, and I enjoy discussing academic topics with others.
    I am currently on the job market (Spring 2025); feel free to contact me!"
