[[introduction]]
    content = "I am a Ph.D student in the NetVerify lab of ANTS group, Xi'an Jiaotong University, supervised by Professor Peng Zhang. My research interest mainly focus on network verification. Specifically, we have proposed the ``Symbolic Router Execution'' framework, which utilizes symbolic simulation to comprehensively reason about network failures (SRE, SIGCOMM '22), and external routes (Expresso, SIGCOMM '24). Currently, I'm working on extending this framework to reason about all converge states of a network. Beyond this framework, I'm working on distributed network simulation, and access control policy verification on public clouds."
