[[introduction]]
    content = "I am a master student of NetVerify lab, Xi'an Jiaotong University, focusing on the data structure (Binary Decision Diagram) under network verification tools. It shows an amazing ability to encode the binary bit array in a compact and logical way. By separating the field like IP and port in data package header, we also decompose fields and wrap the BDD for better performance in network and other verification area, named NDD (Network Decision Diagram, which shows great effect both in memory and time saving)."
