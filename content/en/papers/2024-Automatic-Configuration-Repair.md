abstract = [
    "Networks are error-prone due to misconfigurations, and it is hard to identify the root causes in the configuration and find a repair due to the size and complexity of networks running distributed routing protocols. Thus, we advocate Automatic Configuration Repair to reduce the manual effort. Specifically, we draw some insights from the field of Automatic Software Repair, crystallize some lessons learned from the real-world repair experience of a large service provider, and propose some directions to realize automatic configuration repair. We design one possible method named localize-fix-validate approach, inspired by fault localization and generate-and-validate approach from software repair."
