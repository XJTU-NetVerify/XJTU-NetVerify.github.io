    "Modern networks are increasingly using layering and bridging to form a compositional architecture. 
    Layering protocols like VXLAN create multiple overlay networks on top of a single underlay network infrastructure. 
    This makes network configurations even more complex, and error-prone.
    To check the correctness of such compositional networks, 
    one needs to model the dependency across multiple layers (underlay and overlay) and multiple domains (different VPNs/VPCs). 
    Existing verifiers, which are optimized to scale in single-layer single-domain networks, 
    exhibit scalability limitations when applied to compositional networks.
    This paper proposes MNV a modular network verifier that scales to large compositional networks. 
    At its core is a new verification method termed decompose-merge reasoning, 
    which decomposes the network into self-contained modules, verifies each module independently, and merges the verification results. 
    Our experiments show that for a typical data center network virtualized with VXLAN, 
    to check reachability for more than 100 million pairs of subnets, MNV is at least 100x faster than state-of-the-art tools."
