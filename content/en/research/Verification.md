Traditionally, after a network error is detected, operators use measurement tools to localize the root causes. Such a post-effect approach puts networks at risks of unpredictable down time. Network verification is a revolutional approach: it uses formal methods to either prove the correctness of configurations, or finds counterexamples that violate correctness properties, such that potential outages can be prevented"""
