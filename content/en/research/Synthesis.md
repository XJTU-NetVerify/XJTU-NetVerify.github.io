intro = """Network synthesis aims to automatically generate network configurations or specification, without or with little help from human operators. This is in a similar spirit with hardware synthesis and program synthesis. With the help of formal methods, and the emergence of LLM, we have reasons to believe that a network can autonomously run just like a self-driving car."""

detailedIntro = [
  "Correctly configuring a large network is a challenging and risky task for human operators. So we ask whether we can automatically generate the network configs, just like automatic generation of programs? We tentatively think this is possible, given the success of hardware synthesis and program synthesis, and of course the emergence of LLM. In this direction, we will try to adapt those techniques to the synthesize network configs or repair plans, so that a network can autonomously run and heal without any human."
