intro = """Today, network configurations are very complex. Manually configuring network devices (routers, switches, etc.) is a challenging task, and can easily go wrong and even cause global network outages. Can we automate the process of network configurations, without human in the loop? We envision this is possible, given the success of previous work on hardware synthesis and program synthesis. In recent years, large language models provide new hopes for this vision. We are quite interested in adapting those techniques to make the network configuration process fully automatic, and even more importantly, proven to be correct.
