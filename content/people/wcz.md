[[introduction]]
    content = "In my role focusing on network validation, I handle crucial information at the data link layer. I design and implement algorithms related to spanning trees, performing simulations and verifications of MAC and STP data to ensure the seamless operation of industrial control devices. Additionally, I am engaged in the domain of network traffic forecasting and anomaly detection, where I apply machine learning algorithms for efficient forecasting and classification. I have developed methodologies such as DMFM for prediction and SEMK for classification, both of which have demonstrated high generalizability and effectiveness in empirical tests."
