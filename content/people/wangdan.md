    content = "I am a PhD student in the NetVerify lab, ANTS, Xi'an Jiaotong University, supervised by prof.Peng Zhang. My research topics of interest include network control plane verification. Specifically, I have proposed symbolic router execution which can reason about network failures (SRE, SIGCOMM '22), and external routes (Expresso, SIGCOMM '24)."
