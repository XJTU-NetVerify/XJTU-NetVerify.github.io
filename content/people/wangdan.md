[[introduction]]
    content = "I am a Phd student in the ANTS lab (Xi'an Jiaotong University) led by prof.Peng Zhang. My research topics of interest include network control plane verification. Specifically, I have published papers working on deterministic/probabilistic failure tolerance analyzing (SRE, SIGCOMM2022), external route reasoning (Expresso, SIGCOMM2024), and now I am working distributed control plane simulation."
