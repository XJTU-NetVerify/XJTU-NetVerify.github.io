We are a research lab of ANTS (Advanced NeTworked Systems group), led by Prof. Peng Zhang.
Our lab focuses on the verification, simulation, and emulation of large-scale production computer networks.

Network verification (as well as simulation and emulation) is an exciting direction in computer network, aiming to provide a new toolset for ensuring network reliability. 
In this direction, we have proposed the data plane verifiers APKeep (NSDI'20) and MNV (CoNEXT'23). 
The current research focuses is control plane verification, with preliminary work like DNA (NSDI'22), SRE (SIGCOMM'22), and Expresso (SIGCOMM'24). Some of the work are already open sourced.

Undergraduate students who are interested in the field of network systems, and self-motivated are welcome to join the research group (contact: p-zhang@xjtu.edu.cn)
