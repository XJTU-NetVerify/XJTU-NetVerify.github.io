Network verfication is an exciting new direction in computer network: it leverages formal methods, together with simulation/emulation to ensure the correctness of large and complex computer networks, e.g., datacenter networks, and wide area networks.\nOur lab has been working in network verifiction ever since 2015, with the work of VeriDP (CoNEXT'16). Then, we proposed data plane verifiers APKeep (NSDI'20) and MNV (CoNEXT'23).","date":"2024-04-28T14:45:43+08:00","permalink":"https://xjtu-netverify.github.io/about/","tags":null,"title":"About"}]
