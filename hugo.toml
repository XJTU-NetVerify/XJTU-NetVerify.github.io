As any complex software systems, network controllers are likely to be plagued by bugs that must be discovered and fixed. While discovering these bugs is often hard, fixing them is even harder. As network controllers are critical entity, they cannot simply be “rebooted”, they must run at all time to ensure smooth and continuous network operations.
